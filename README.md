Pivot Table and Dashboard Details:
Total Sales Sheet:
Pivot Table "TotalSales": Created to visually represent aggregate sales over different time periods.
Initial Issue: The data was grouped by years, making trend analysis less precise.
Modification: Data was reorganized into monthly and yearly groups, allowing for a more granular view of sales trends.
Columns Added:
"Coffee Type Name" (for Y-axis)
"Sales" (for values)
The Y-axis captures sales quantities over time, broken down by coffee type.
Visualization:
Added a 2D Line Chart to represent sales trends.
Inserted a Timeline feature (from PivotChart Analyzer) to dynamically narrow down and analyze specific timeframes.
Slicers Added:
Size
Roast Name Type
Loyalty Card
Country Bar Chart Sheet:
Created a bar chart to show the countries with the highest sales in descending order.
Top 5 Customers:
Developed a bar chart where customer names are plotted on the axis.
Sorted the data in descending order and applied a Top 5 filter to display the leading customers.
Dashboard Sheet:
A new sheet titled “Dashboard” was created to consolidate and present interactive visuals.
Established connections between all slicers and the visual elements, ensuring that applied filters are reflected across all associated graphs.
